# crystalsort
Demo code for a sorting algorithm intended for use with neural networks.

Depends on Penlight, a Lua utility library. Otherwise dependencies should be built-in.

To run, make sure you have a folder in your home directory titled "crystal_pics". For use in actual projects, you'll want to read and modify the (heavily-commented) code.
